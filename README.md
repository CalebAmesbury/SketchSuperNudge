## Keyboard Shortcuts

`CTRL + ⇧ + arrow keys`: nudge 50 pixels

Want to nudge by another variable? Just edit the .skethplugin files with your favorite text editor.



**NOTE: These keyboard shortcuts may already be assigned by default in OSX.  To change these go to `System Preferences> Mission Control` and look for `"Mission Control"` and `"Application Windows"`.
